#### Outline

1. This study contributed to research and development on a Iron/Scintillator Calorimeter for a second detector at the Electron-Ion Collider. The Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) will be the first polarized electron-proton collider and will investigate the internal structure and dynamics of the nucleons as well as the nature of the force that holds them together. The EIC plans to have two detectors: the ePIC detector and a second detector which is still under research and development. Plans for the second detector include a Calorimeter composed of alternating iron and scintillating material that will provide particle identification for muons and hadrons, as well as calorimetry. This detector will differ from ePIC, extending the range of physics to be studied at the EIC.
2. Accurate and efficient simulations are key to studying physics at the EIC. The second detector calorimeter requires software to simulate the physics ocurring when particles interact with the detector, producing an output analogous to that of the real detector. The present study continued work on the implementation of the detector geometry in a suitable detector description software allowing the geometry to be used for simulations. To improve computation efficiency of the simulations, research and development was performed to implement a parameterization of the optical photon simulation. This parameterization allows for simulating events without simulating optical photon physics, while still producing an accurate readout based on studies of the full photon simulation.
3. The simulation software will be integral to producing projections for the EIC second detector, and will aid in the future physics studies that will use EIC data when the collider begins taking data.

## Affinity

Big picture

1. single pion results at CLAS12 of TMD affinity

#### Outline

1. This study applies a new tool for measuring the applicability of factorization theorems, referred to as affinity, to the kinematics of JLab fixed target electron-proton scattering experiments. Different factorization theorems are valid for different kinematic regions of semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering experiments. Affinity can be used to estimate the proximity of a kinematic bin from a factorization theorem, and relies on partonic kinematics to produce a value. The original work which proposed the tool produced projections for affinity for different experiments including JLab, utilizing simple models to approximate partonic kinematics which are not observable. The present study investigates the affinity of specific kinematics at JLab using partonic kinematics produced by Monte-Carlo simulations of the experiment. We find that the simulated partonic kinematics differ from the models used in the original work, opening the door to extensions based on more realistic partonic descriptions. Furthermore, we project affinity values with similar trends but  <results go here but for now...>  overall higher values of affinity in the TMD region, suggesting higher likelihood of TMD factorization applying to the JLab kinematics. </ END RESULTS> We also suggest a model for extending affinity to di-hadron physics where multiple final state hadrons are observed, allowing for higher degrees of freedom <THIS IS LIKELY NOT STAYING IN>
