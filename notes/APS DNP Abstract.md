#### Outline

1. We conducted research and development on a Iron/Scintillator Calorimeter for a second detector at the Electron-Ion Collider. The Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) will be the first polarized electron-proton collider and will investigate the internal structure and dynamics of the nucleons. Accurate and efficient simulations are key to studying physics at the EIC. The present study continued the implementation of the detector geometry in a suitable detector description software allowing use in physics simulations. To improve computation efficiency of the simulations, research and development went into a parameterization of the optical photon simulation. This parameterization allows for simulating the physics of the detector without simulating optical photon physics, producing an accurate readout based on studies of the full photon simulation. The simulation software will be integral to producing projections for the EIC second detector, and will aid in the future physics studies at the EIC when data taking begins.

## Affinity

Big picture

1. single pion results at CLAS12 of TMD affinity

#### Outline

1. This study applies a new tool for measuring the applicability of factorization theorems, referred to as affinity, to the kinematics of JLab fixed target electron-proton scattering experiments. Different factorization theorems are valid for different kinematic regions of semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering experiments. Affinity can be used to estimate the proximity of a kinematic bin from a factorization theorem, and relies on partonic kinematics to produce a value. The original work which proposed the tool produced projections for affinity for different experiments including JLab, utilizing simple models to approximate partonic kinematics which are not observable. The present study investigates the affinity of specific kinematics at JLab using partonic kinematics produced by Monte-Carlo simulations of the experiment. We find that the simulated partonic kinematics differ from the models used in the original work, opening the door to extensions based on more realistic partonic descriptions. Furthermore, we project affinity values with similar trends but  <results go here but for now...>  overall higher values of affinity in the TMD region, suggesting higher likelihood of TMD factorization applying to the JLab kinematics. </ END RESULTS> We also suggest a model for extending affinity to di-hadron physics where multiple final state hadrons are observed, allowing for higher degrees of freedom <THIS IS LIKELY NOT STAYING IN>
