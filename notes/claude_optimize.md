Thank you for providing the profiler output. This gives us valuable insights into where the computational bottlenecks are in your model. Let's analyze this and suggest some optimizations:

1. Linear layers (aten::linear and aten::addmm) are taking up the most CUDA time. This is expected for normalizing flows.

2. GEMM (General Matrix Multiply) operations (ampere_sgemm_128x64_tn and ampere_sgemm_32x128_tn) are also significant contributors.

3. There's a noticeable time spent on aten::cumsum, which is often used in normalizing flows for calculating cumulative sums.

4. aten::cat operations are taking a significant amount of CPU time.

Based on this, here are some targeted optimizations:

1. Fuse operations:
   Try to fuse linear layers with activation functions. This can be done using torch.nn.utils.fusion.fuse_conv_bn_eval() for convolutional layers, or by manually implementing fused layers.

2. Optimize matrix multiplications:
   Ensure you're using the optimal sizes for your tensors. PyTorch often performs better with sizes that are multiples of 8.

3. Reduce concatenation operations:
   The aten::cat operation is taking a lot of CPU time. Try to minimize tensor concatenations, possibly by pre-allocating tensors.

4. Use TensorFloat-32 (TF32):
   If you're using an NVIDIA Ampere GPU, enable TF32:
   ```python
   torch.backends.cuda.matmul.allow_tf32 = True
   torch.backends.cudnn.allow_tf32 = True
   ```

5. Optimize cumsum:
   If possible, try to replace cumsum operations with more efficient alternatives.

6. Use torch.compile() with specific configs:
   ```python
   compiled_model = torch.compile(model, mode="reduce-overhead", fullgraph=True, backend="inductor")
   ```

7. Optimize data movement:
   Ensure all your data is on GPU and minimize CPU-GPU transfers.

8. Batch normalization:
   If you're using batch normalization, make sure to call model.eval() before inference to use running statistics.

9. Use AMP (Automatic Mixed Precision):
   ```python
   from torch.cuda.amp import autocast
   with autocast():
       output = model(input)
   ```

10. Optimize your dataloader:
    Ensure you're using num_workers > 0 and pin_memory=True in your DataLoader.

11. CUDA Graphs:
    If your input sizes are constant, consider using CUDA graphs:
    ```python
    static_input = torch.randn(batch_size, input_size, device='cuda')
    static_context = torch.randn(batch_size, context_size, device='cuda')
    
    g = torch.cuda.CUDAGraph()
    with torch.cuda.graph(g):
        static_output = model(static_input, static_context)
    
    # In your inference loop
    static_input.copy_(real_input)
    static_context.copy_(real_context)
    g.replay()
    output = static_output
    ```

12. Model pruning:
    Consider pruning less important weights in your model to reduce computation.

Remember to benchmark each change to see its impact. Some optimizations might work better than others depending on your specific model and hardware.

If you implement these optimizations and still don't see significant improvements, we might need to look into custom CUDA kernels or more fundamental changes to your model architecture. Let me know how these suggestions work out!
