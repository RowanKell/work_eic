# Work Notes Sunday July 7th

## Affinity

1. Need more data to get more statistics in the single b
1. should be around 3m events with 3 files

## EIC KLM

### Solenoid:

Inner vacuum vessel ~ 4 cm Al, density 2.5
 Inner radiation shield few mm ~ 2 mm Cu, density 9
 Coil 6 cm - a 5:1 mix of Cu and NbTi (i.e., with Nb =Ti, a 10:1:1 mix of Cu, Nb, and Ti)
 Coil support cylinder ~ 7 cm Al, density 2.5
 Outer radiation shield ~ 2 mm Cu, density 9
 Outer vacuum vessel Al ~ 10 cm Al, density 2.5

field strength: 1.5T?

# Tuesday July 9th

## Affinity

1. Need to create a tree with values only from events in the kinematic bin we are looking at.
   1. Running driver on all 3 million+ events takes hours
2. kinematics needed from MC:
   1. ratios
   2. pT, Q2, x, z, qTQ for plotting
