# Affinity Meeting July 10

1. Figure out today which bins are best to explore
2. which are the bins where we trust MC better
3. Can we use affinity as a quantitative thing or just qualitative
4. Goal: fit partonic distributions
   1. Tune affinity method, apply to EIC and JLab12

low TMD aff Kinematics

1. Q2 = 3
2. pT = 0.3
3. x = 0.15
4. z = 0.3
5. hadron: charged pion
6. target: proton

high TMD aff Kinematics

1. Q2 = 3
2. pT = 0.02
3. x = 0.15
4. z = 0.3
5. hadron: charged pion
6. target: proton

My stuff

1. Calculate qT from z_N and see how that compares
2.
