these files were run as a batch of slurm files. Info:
1. one_segment with sensor as sensitive
2. optical photons on
3. purpose: shoot at different angles to achieve different path lengths and see dependence of time resolution on path length / energy dep / # photons.
4. Uses same position by changing gun position and angle each time so that the hit position doesn't affect the timing
5. Should use this to plot the average travel time for diff angles to see if we see a dependence - if so we need to include in parameterization. If not, we can assume it doesn't impact and call it good.
