June 24th - variation x pos
July 19
    1. slurm - one segment, currently used, corresponds to July 21st run 1 pt files
    2. full_sector_optph
        1. used, provides real timing distribution for comparison

    1. sector_sensor
        1. NOTE: Runs 1 and 2 are full, non segmented layers
            Use run 3 for segmented layers
        2. full sector, optical photons on and sensor sensitive
        3. Use as "truth" times for comparing infered data
    2. sector_scint
        1. full sector, scint sensitive - used as input for NF to infer times
        1. vary theta - vary theta for range of theta values rather than just 90 deg
