These steering files are designed to work with eic-klm geometries that have the sensor set to sensitive (and are created). Optical photons are turned ON. This means that one bar simulations will be ~20/min and full sector simulations will take ~1/min

use keepALL to keep all MCParticles to get accurate photon percentage yield
